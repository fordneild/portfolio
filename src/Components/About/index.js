								I'm Ford, a software engineer at Carta, a

								Before graduating from Johns Hopkins in 2021
								with a B.S. in Computer Science, I built
								beautiful single-page applications for the
								Atlantic, a sleek marketing web app for Way2B1,
								a production client onboarding tool at Komodo
								Health, and founded Memehub with my peers.
							</p>
							<p>
								From brainstorming aggressive product road maps,
								to creating a delightful UX and deploying
								scalable backend services, I think each problem
								presents its own unique and exciting challenges
								to solve.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, I'm interested in growing my technical
								skills at Carta while finding new tedious tasks
								to automate in the investor service domain.
								Outside work, I am also interested in
								entrepreneurship, weight lifting, reading,
								VipassanƒÅ, exploring new restaurants in NYC, and
								painting with Bob Ross.
